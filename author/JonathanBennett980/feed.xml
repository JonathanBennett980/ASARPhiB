	     <p>“Democracy” initially stands for: the power to the people.
Do you feel like you are in control?
If you answered no, learn what Open Government is and why we should adopt it !</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Most of the modern democracies are in fact some form of <em>representative</em> democracies.
Meaning that the people elects representatives that will then rule the country by creating, applying and interpreting laws.
This leads to situation where the people actually express its will only by electing representatives, so approximately once per year.</p>

<p>Now, why wouldn’t we form some <em>direct</em> democracies ?
The main argument, few centuries ago, was that it was not possible to manage a whole population voting on each issue.
And this was fine then.
But is it now ?</p>

<h1 id="opinion-and-argumentation">Opinion and Argumentation</h1>

<p>In my opinion, of course, it is not: today democracies are obsolete.
We have the necessary means to create more direct democracies, which I consider better.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-more-direct-democracies-better">Why are more direct democracies better?</h2>

<p>I consider direct democracies to be better for many reasons and here are a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You might agree on most subject with the person you elect to represent you but what about the other subjects ? Wouldn’t it be easier (except for organizational reasons) to represent yourself… well yourself ?</li>
  <li>The person you elected to represent you is generally elected for a time span (often a few years). What if that person changes with time ? You cannot tell what he/she will be in 2 or three years.</li>
  <li>Most of the politicians come from higher social classes. This is problematic, because the population might not be represented equitably.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-more-direct-democracies-instead-of-direct-democracies">Why <em>more</em> direct democracies instead of direct democracies?</h2>

<p>In think that specialization, to some extend, is great idea and beneficent tool.
Following that reasoning, I would say that there are complicated subjects and decisions about those should be delegated to groups of experts specialized in that subject.
Also, it would be impossible to have the people vote on <em>every</em> issues a government faces.
In my view, neither extreme is good and we are at the representative extreme.</p>

<h2 id="what-now-">What Now ?</h2>

<p>OK, so more direct democracies are probably better.
What do we do now?</p>

<h1 id="wait-for-it-open-government">Wait for it… Open Government</h1>

<p><img src="assets/images/posts/openGovernment-wordCloud.jpg" alt="Open Government Word Cloud" /></p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p><em>Note: the definition below might not correspond to the generally accepted definition, or put emphasis on different parts.</em></p>

<p><strong>Open Government</strong>: An Open Source movement that aims to make government data open to the public and to promote civic participation.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-could-be">What it Could Be</h2>

<p>Imagine that your government creates an app or website which allows you to vote, to obtain official dataset easily, to complete administrative procedures and to report problems (like pothole, broken stuffs, etc.).
Individuals’ life would be easier, contacts with the government would make society more efficient, resources would be better used and transparency would make it harder for corruption to exist.
This is what Open Government could look like.</p>

<p>You can even think it one step further.
For example, if there existed a platform where you could download governmental dataset, then you could imagine having citizen or universities doing data mining on it to find ways to optimize how resources are used.</p>

<h1 id="a-little-example">A Little Example</h1>

<p>A few months back, I traveled to Europe.
During my trip, I visited a few countries, one of which is quite relevant to the thematic at hand: Switzerland.</p>

<p>This little country has a very peculiar system and the Swiss people <strong>votes on average four times a year on elections but also on policies and so-called initiatives</strong>.
My point being: There exists some countries where a more direct democracy is used and it works.
In fact it works greatly for Switzerland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Switzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth, being ranked as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Wikipedia, 04-09-2018</a></p>

	     <p>Over-population, pollution, global warming, ecology.
We hear those often but was is really going on?
What is actually over-population or pollution?
Should we be concerned?
My answer: definitely Yes!
And here is why.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>In this article, I will use a very engineer-like approach best summarized with the following pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">situation = get_situation_under_consideration()
optimization_criteria = situation.get_most_important_criteria()

if optimization_criteria.is_maximized():
    pass

else:
    problem = situation.discover_underlying_problem()
    return problem.find_solution()
</code></pre>

<p>In this article, we will consider Earth’s present day situation.</p>

<h1 id="optimization-criteria">Optimization Criteria</h1>

<p>Let’s first make an egoistic assumption here and say that we want humanity to survive on the long term<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.
This will be our first criterion.</p>

<p><strong>Criterion 1</strong>: Humanity should survive on the long term</p>

<p>Survival is probably not enough on its own, we want something more in our life, at least I do.
So I will define my second criterion the following way:</p>

<p><strong>Criterion 2</strong>: Humans should have enjoyable lives</p>

<p>I will not give a proper definition of what “enjoyable” is, because I am not sure it is possible to find a definition everzone accepts.
For now I will just assume we have a common understanding of what an <em>unenjoyable</em> life is, which is enough to determine if life enjoyability is maximized.</p>

<p>Awesome, so here are my optimization criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Human survival</li>
  <li>Life enjoyability</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="time-for-observation">Time For Observation</h1>

<p>Now that I have fixed what I want to optimize, let’s look at the current situation and determine if we should change anything to the way we do things.</p>

<p>You probably guessed it, in my opinion, life enjoyability is not maximized <em>at all</em> on Earth and human survival could become a real question in the short term.</p>

<p>Poverty and hunger in Africa</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/posts/africa_poverty.png" alt="Poverty in Africa" /></p>

<p>Pollution and health issues in China</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/posts/air_pollution.jpg" alt="Pollution in China" /></p>

<p>Over-population in India</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/posts/overpopulation_india.jpg" alt="Over-population in India" /></p>

<p>There exist many other examples across the globe.</p>

<h1 id="understanding-the-problem">Understanding the Problem</h1>

<p>So what went wrong?
Well, before going any further in this reflection, let’s try have a deeper understanding of some of our optimization criteria.</p>

<h2 id="what-human-survival-is-made-of">What Human Survival is Made Of</h2>

<p>Our survival depends maily on us being able to stay alive.
To stay alive, we need enough energy to function and a good health, as simple as that.</p>

<h2 id="core-components-of-an-enjoyable-life">Core Components of an Enjoyable Life</h2>

<p>How could we define an “enjoyable life” so that anyone would agree with the definition?
Finding good definition is a really complicated problem and I won’t pretend I have one for what an “enjoyable life” is.
On the other hand I think it is possible to identify  a few components that could reasonably appear in all possible definitions.</p>

<p>Alright so a first component I find reasonable is <strong>health</strong>.
Staying healthy is often a very important part of having an enjoyable life.</p>

<p>Second, I think that all humans want some kind of <strong>comfort</strong>.
Comfort might be very primitive like having enough to eat and a roof above one’s head, but we all want some.
It seems quite clear from the previous example that comfort strongly depends on <em>resources</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I think that all humans want to have the chance of doing cool experiences, I’ll talk about <strong>opportunities</strong>.
And those do, one way or another, also depend on <em>resources</em>.
Let’s consider a few examples.
Assume you have the opportunity to visit a foreign country.
You will need resources to travel there (fuel if you take car or plane, food if you go by foot or bike, etc).
You will also want to have some accommodation there (heat, light, food, shelter built using raw materials) which requires resources and opportunities to visit and discover which, themselves, will also require some form of resources.
Basically, every actions we perform require resources (whether it is simply the energy needed to move our muscle that we gain from eating food or resources we use to create and power machine that perform actions for us).
And the more resources we have at our disposal, the more things we can do, so the more opportunities we can have.</p>

<p>So we were able to pinpoint a very interesting common denominator: resources (for which I do have a definition this time).</p>

<p><strong>Resource</strong>:
Energy stored under a precise form that human kind can use.
Example: food, fossil fuel, wind.</p>

<p>Thus the life enjoyability metrics in our modern society becomes very dependent on resources.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>Humankind requires many <em>different</em> kind of resources: food, wood, electricity, heat, light, etc.</p>

<p>Resources available to us on Earth are limited though.
A reasonable model for human accessible resources is given hereafter.
Earth’s only source of energy is the Sun.
As we can directly exploit Sun’s energy (solar panels, solar heat plants, etc) I will consider it a resource in itself.
However, let’s note that we are not capable of transforming the Sun’s energy into all the types of resources we need (e.g. there are no human machine that can produce wood or food out of the Sun’s radiations).
But the Sun’s energy can be transformed by non-human entities living on Earth like plants and those provide us with the resources that we are not capable of creating ourselves.
Finally Earth also has a certain amount of stored resources like fossil fuels, already existing plants, radioactive matter, etc.</p>

<p>A few key takeaway points here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The total quantity of energy Earth receives per time unit is finite and defined by the Sun.</li>
  <li>We are unable to produce some of the forms of resources we need. This point is very important: it highlights the fact that <em>we are very much dependent on the environment to provide us with the resources we need</em>.</li>
  <li>Resources <em>stored</em> on Earth are finite, hence using more resources than the produced ones per time unit cannot be done for long: at some point we will simply run out of them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s formalize this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r(t) = egr(t) + hgr(t) + reserves(t)</script>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(r(t)\) is the total human available resources at a given point of time. Unit: \([ressource]\)</li>
  <li>\(egr(t)\) are the environment generated resources at a given point of time. Units: \([ressource]\)</li>
  <li>\(hgr(t)\) are the human generated resources directly from the sun energy which nowadays is a very very small proportion of the total resources we consume. Units: \([ressource]\)</li>
  <li>\(reserves(t)\) are Earth’s stored resources at a given point of time. Units: \([ressource]\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we know what our optimization criteria actually rely on, let’s discover why they are not maximized.</p>

<p>An index I find really interesting about resource consumption, to have an idea is the planet equivalent.
It basically boils down to “How many planets would we need to have all humans living like &lt;nationality&gt;?”.
For example, if we all wanted to have an american lifestyle, we would require the resources produced by <em>five</em> planet Earth!
On the other hand, if we all lived like Indians, we would only require 0.6 planet (<a href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/">Foot Print Network</a>).</p>

<p>It is estimated that the present day human population consumes 1.7 Earths…
We probably won’t be able to do it for long.</p>

<h2 id="two-major-problems-over-population-and-pollution">Two Major Problems: Over Population and Pollution</h2>

<p>In the media we often hear about pollution, and over-population.
We all have some understanding of those terms but what are we talking about exactly, and are they really so bad?</p>

<p>There is an intrinsic human perspective in the terms “over-population” and “pollution”.
The Earth does not care about over-population or pollution, whatever that is.
It was here long before us and will continue to do so long after we disappear.</p>

<p>One could argue that pollution and global warming are also animal and vegetal problem.
I would absolutely agree, but when humans talk about pollution or over-population, they generally refers to the troubles it could cause <em>them</em>, not the troubles it causes other species.
So let’s assume this perspective too.</p>

<p>Cool, so now, let’s try to define those terms and prove that they are key components of the problems we acknowldged above.</p>

<h3 id="over-population-and-lifestyle">Over Population (and Lifestyle)</h3>

<p><strong>Over-population</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Overpopulation occurs when a species’ population exceeds the carrying capacity of its ecological niche.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpopulation">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will define a few variables here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(lifestyle\), that represent the average lifestyle of a population.</li>
  <li>\(pop\), the total total number of humans on Earth (\(pop\) for population). Units: \([individual]\)</li>
  <li>\(cri(lifestyle)\), the average consumed resources per individual per unit of time for a given lifestyle. Unit: \([ressource/(individual \cdot time)]\)</li>
</ul>

<p>So over population is the state were:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
egr(t) + hgr(t) < pop(t) \times cri(lifestyle) %]]></script>

<p>This situation diminishes Earth’s stored resources \(ressources(t)\).
And at some given point in time \(ressources(t_1) = 0\).
Then we won’t have enough ressources available for our entire population to maintain its lifestyle.
This generally results in lifestyle pejoration which lowers life enjoyability.
Actually, this lifestyle pejoration can be bad enough so that at some point it event threaten the very survival of the individuals (famine are an example of such a situation).
This now also impacts negatively our first criterion: human kind survival.</p>

<p>Hence using more resources than what the environment provides is a bad idea that will eventually catch up with us.</p>

<p>Mathematically one can summarize the maximal amount of ressources an individual should consume the following way:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">mri(t) = \frac{epr(t) + hgr(t)}{pop(t)}</script>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(mri\) is the maximum resource quantity an individual should consume in average. Unit: \([resource/individual]\)</li>
</ul>

<p>If \(mri(t) \lt cri(lifestyle)\), then the life enjoyability index is diminished because we simply cannot sustain having the wanted lifestyle as the maximum available resources per individual in less than the resources that would be needed for the given lifestyle.
We remark that when the population becomes big, the \(mri\) get smaller.
If the population get very big, then, at some point, \(mri\) will become less than \(cri\) and the above described situation will occur.</p>

<p>This a reason why over-population is a problem.</p>

<h3 id="pollution">Pollution</h3>

<p><strong>Pollution</strong>: Adding substances or energy of some form (nose, light, etc) so fast into the environment that it causes changes that are harmful to human kind.</p>

<p>In my opinion, pollution is problematic for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It impacts human health directly which has a negative impact on the optimization of human survival and life enjoyability.</li>
  <li>It indirectly diminishes human resources (e.g. ocean pollution causing fishes to die, massive bees extinction have had disastrous consequences on harvests), and thus lowers our life enjoyability.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s again try to formalize this idea.</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(pollution\) represents the total quantity of substances and energy released by human kind in the environment. Units: \([pollution]\)</li>
  <li>\(pi\) is the average pollution per individual. Units: \([pollution/individual]\)</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">pollution(t) = pop(t) \times pi(lifestyle)</script>

<p>Let’s make a few remarks here.
As the definition tells us, pollution is problematic only above a certain threshold.
So problems only arise when \(pollution(t) &gt; epac\) where \(epac\) is the environment pollution absorbance capacity.</p>

<p>Do we generate more pollution than what the environment can absorb?
If you ask me, it simply makes no doubt.
To prove this claim, I will refer to the definition: are we polluting the environment enough that it causes troubles to us?
Consider global warming and all the issues related to it (ocean rise, extrem climatical events, desertification, etc).
You have your answer.</p>

<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>

<p>Thanks to the formulas above we can easily find a lot of solutions.
But first, let’s define a few things we want to keep constant or even increase.
In my opinion, \(lifestyle\) should not be decreased, on the contrary, it should increase.</p>

<p>So what can we do?</p>

<p>We could <strong>reduce the pollution generated per individual</strong>.
It is often considered a part of <em>ecology</em>: have the same lifestyle but reduce the generated pollution by it (recycling, less wrapping, local products, etc).
We do it to some extend, but I believe we could do much more.
Technology and innovation have big role to play here.
This solution can help lower pollution and hence improves life enjoyability and human survival.</p>

<p>We could also improve <strong>resource efficiency</strong> which, in essence, means consuming less resources, while maintaining the same lifestyle.
This is also often considered a part of ecology.
Again technology and innovation have a big role to play here.
This solution can help lower ressource consumption and hence improves life enjoyability.</p>

<p>But the two above given solutions can only have limited impact because there are fundamental limits to what can be done.
Most action have a physical minimum amount of energy needed (transport can be made more efficient by reducing waste and friction for example but Newton’s law \(F = m \cdot a\) sets the minimum required enegry).</p>

<p>The solution I think has the biggest long term potential impact is <strong>human population reduction</strong>.
This would reduce the total pollution generated and increase the total ressources available per individuals, thus improving life enjoyability and not changing human kind survival (I mean with 500 millions individuals, our chances of survival are as high as if we are 9 billions in my opinion).</p>

<p>Note that I do not pretend to propose solutions to diminish the human population on Earth.
This is yet another complex problem and finding ethical solutions to it is actually quite complicated.
I just say that if we could limit the human population, it would solve a lot of problems.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-another-world">Imagine Another World</h2>

<p>To conclude this article, imagine what a world with only 500 millions human being (which is roughly equivalent to the american population) would look like.</p>

<p>Here is how I envisage the situation.
All humans would have decided to live on a single continent.
The one that suffers the less from extreme climatical events like tornados, earthquakes or tsunamis.
500 millions probably represent enough human beings to maintain our lifestyle.
It would simplify politics a lot as we could form only one country.
Individuals could also pollute more while without causing much damage to the environment (you could take the plane without having problems of conscience for example).</p>

<p>Moreover it would allow many places on Earth to be exempt from human traces and authentique human-exempt areas could exists (which is an idea I find facinating).</p>

<h2 id="further-ideas">Further Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="an-argument-for-biodiversity-and-environmental-protection-to-some-extent">An Argument for Biodiversity and Environmental Protection (To Some Extent)</h3>

<p>I said earlier that some forms of resources on Earth are only generated by plants.
Actually human kind mostly relies on its environment to provide it with the resources it needs.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the machine producing the various resources we need, plants and animals, also happen to be the resources.
It gets even crazier when we remark that the quantity of plants at \(t+1\) actually also depends on the plant quantity at \(t\) (this comes from the fact that plants reproduce, i.e. plants are their own factory, they are not produce by an external source).
In short, plants and animals are self-generating, resource-producent and resource themselves.</p>

<p>Cool, let’s now assume that we want to maximize the total resource quantity made available to us by the environment over time.
The question is how many plants (I will talk about plants only but this can be generalized to animals) can we harvest and transform into resources now and how many plants should we leave alone so that they serve plant generation.</p>

<p>The total harvested ressources are given with the following formula:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">resources = \sum_t harvest(t)</script>

<p>Where \(harvest(t)\) is the amount of plants harvested at time \(t\).
But we need to understand how plants evolve with time to understand what the possible values of \(harvest\) are.
For example if \(harvest(t_1) = plants(t_1)\), then all subsequent harvests will be zero (because you used all plants and left no one to perpetuate the plant stock).
This probably means that we won’t maximize the total harvest.</p>

<p>A simple model is the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">plants(t) = \lambda (plants(t-1) - harvest(t))</script>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(plants(t)\) represent the quantity of entities that produce resources for us in some form at a given point of time.</li>
  <li>\(\lambda\) is the reproduction rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>NB: Such models do have complicated mathematical solutions.
The model presented here is also very simple and does not take in account many complicated aspects (like the fact that some resources get stale with time).</p>

<p>The main point is that if one harvests more than what the environment can compensate for, then, over time, the available quantity of plants gets lower and lower until you reach zero which is clearly not a good solution.
I believe that we are currently doing exactly that: harvesting more resources than what the environment can compensate for.
And this will most likely create very important troubles in a not so distant future, hence the need to stop over exploiting the environment.</p>

<p>Now some bits about biodiversity.
Recent years, most probably because of pollution, we have witnessed one of the most massive species extinction rate in Earth history.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/images/posts/extinction_rate.png" alt="Extinction rate" /></p>

<p>Fine, what’s the matter?
Well the problem is that a loss of biodiversity implies a loss of genetical diversity.
And this genetical diversity ensures the environment is ready to face changes, which guarantees to us humans that the environment will never stop providing us with resources.
In my opinion, it is therefore very important to preserve biodiversity.</p>

<h3 id="an-argument-for-equitable-resource-sharing-among-humans">An Argument for Equitable Resource Sharing Among Humans</h3>

<p>We said we wanted to maximize life enjoyability and saw that it depended on resources.
In this article, I implicitely considered that resources were shared equitably.
Of course this is not the case and having a better distribution of resources across individuals wuld probably be a very good idea for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person with no resources probably has a very unenjoyable life</li>
  <li>Studies have shown that above a certain limit, having more resources does not make one happier</li>
</ul>

<p>Changing resources distribution however is highly untrivial and will probably require a change of system.
I will try to write an article about this in the future.</p>

<p>Hence you always try to find very easily acceptable axioms because if everyone agrees on the axioms you chose and if you proof is logically correct, then everyone should agree with your conclusion.
Unfortunetaly it is highly non-trivial to find such axioms, especially if you want your proof to remain true across different populations, continents, cultures and time epochs.
In that regard I find the axiom “Humanity should survive” very interesting because survival is probably implemented in our genes to some extent.
And therefore I believe it is very easy easy to accept that axiom.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>We live in a very peculiar time, one of technologies, of increasing speed, of ever evolving theories and concepts.
<em>To survive in such hostile environment, one has to adapt… fast!</em>
This often imply learning new things to stay up to date, forging new habits, changing one’s way of thinking, embracing new cultures, etc.</p>

<h1 id="a-philosophy-of-change">A Philosophy of Change</h1>

<h2 id="why-change-matters">Why Change Matters</h2>

<p>The reasons cited above make me believe that <em>change is an important skill</em> to master.</p>

<p>But change can bring oneself more than just a way to adapt, it can be an occasion to <em>discover new cultures, new persons, maybe new friends</em>.
Trying to change can lead the way to creating unforgettable memories, which in the end are all the things a human being truly possesses.
It can make you to be more knowledgeable, make you wiser, make you discover new points of view, etc.</p>

<p>And for all those reasons, I <em>like</em> changing.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-change">How to Change?</h2>

<h3 id="adapt-yourself-to-adaptation">Adapt Yourself To Adaptation</h3>

<p>Adaptation is one of the most fundamental way of surviving on the long term.
It used to be a lengthy process that could take many years.</p>

<p>But nowadays adaptation has to happen fast.
For example, when you start a new job, you may have to learn new skills in a matter of weeks.
If you move out to another country, you may have to insert yourself into a new culture.
Or even imagine you finally proposed to your girlfriend to move in, you will then have to adapt to a new every day life if you don’t want your relationship to go south (OK, this last example might be a bit exaggerated but you get the idea).
You never know what life has planned for you.</p>

<p>So how can one be ready to adapt to change?</p>

<p>Well, I believe that <em>changing is a skill that can be learn</em>.
<em>Hence, the more you change, the easier you’ll find it to change</em>, it is a circle.
So to ready yourself, you have to change regularly.</p>

<p>How can one change regularly will you ask me…
Well, in my opinion, it implies renouncing to some of your routines or habits.
Do you have a café where you always like to go to chat with your friends?
Do you have a preferred spot in the library where you always go to work or read?
Do you always eat the same things at the cafeteria?</p>

<p>If this is the case, try changing those little things: try another meal, seat somewhere else (or even try another library), choose another café, etc.
Doing this will put you outside of your comfort zone, and I won’t lie: at first, it is not easy!
Habits are comfortable, they work as landmark in our everyday life and abandoning them implies to have the courage of embracing the unknown.
To diminish the initial fear of change, try very small changes and increase progressively the changes’ importance.</p>

<p>In the end you will feel comfortable even if you find yourself in a totally unknown place with totally unknown persons doing totally unknown things because you will be confident that you can adapt to the situation.</p>

<h3 id="always-learn">Always Learn</h3>

<p>Another way to change is to learn new things, when possible on very differentiated subjects.
One can do this, for example, by reading books and taking notes on them.
And I will emphasize here on the importance of learning things on <em>differentiated</em> subjects.
This is one of the most efficient ways I have ever found to widen or even change my points of view.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-undertake">Changes to Undertake?</h2>

<h3 id="easy-ones">Easy ones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Try new meals</li>
  <li>Seat somewhere else than your usual spot</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intermediate-level">Intermediate Level</h3>

  <li>Learn something new by reading a book</li>
  <li>Test a new sport (Try something crazy like Parkour)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-the-hardcore-ones">For the Hardcore Ones</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Try learning to write with the wrong hand</li>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>The open source movement is an alternative way of working and cooperating that could very well change our society.
It is based on cooperation instead of exchanges and is already a standard in the digital world.
But many applications of it are possible especially in the real world.</p>

<h1 id="the-open-source-a-revolution">The Open (Source), a Revolution</h1>

<h2 id="back-to-the-origins-the-open-source-movement">Back to the Origins: The Open Source Movement</h2>

<h3 id="a-quick-definition-of-open-source">A Quick Definition of Open Source</h3>

<p>An open source software must provide the four following liberties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The liberty to use the software</li>
  <li>The liberty to view the source code (useful if you want to learn how to code for example)</li>
  <li>The liberty to modify the code (so that you can take a program and modifz it in order to make it match your exact needs)</li>
  <li>The liberty to distribute your modified version of the code</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-main-characteristic-of-open-source">The Main Characteristic of Open Source</h2>

<p>The whole idea behind open source software is that a program should rely on a community of users and programmers.
This community can then propose changes, implement them and make them available to all!
By doing that you give the control back to the persons that use the software.
That way, you are certain that the software corresponds to the needs of the persons using it.
And if the community is big enough it also ensure great quality of code, a lot of support provided by more experienced user to least experienced ones, rapid improvements and adaptation to newer needs, etc.</p>

<p>In a somewhat broader sense, one could consider an open source software as simply a cooperation between human beings.
By improving the program, you will not gain money but you will be cooperating with humanity.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-open-source-software">Examples of Open Source Software</h2>

<p>Open source software are everywhere.
Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The linux operating system</li>
  <li>The android operating system</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>LibreOffice</li>
  <li>Gimp (used for photo editing)</li>
  <li>Blender (to create animated movies)</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, at least 70% of the Internet is run by open source software (the vast majority of the computers powering Internet run Linux as operating system, most of the web server like Apache are open source, most of the protocols on the internet are open source, etc.).
Almost all programming languages are open source too.</p>

<p>Amongst non-open source software, one can find: The Apple ecosystem (iOs, Pages, Keynote, etc.), the Microsoft ecosystem (Windows, Microsoft Office, etc), the Adobe ecosystem (Photoshop, InDesign, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="fine-but-why-should-i-care">Fine, But Why Should I Care?</h2>

<p>Open source software is probably of little concern for you, but the ideas it conveys certainly are not!</p>

<p>From the open source originated a lot of other open movements like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open Hardware (Arduino and RaspberryPi for example)</li>
  <li>Open Beer (open beer receipes)</li>
  <li>Open Data (data available to all online to easily make statistics or researches)</li>
  <li>Open Science</li>
  <li>Open Government</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-revolution">A Revolution</h3>

<p>I believe that all those movements will transform our society in a very profound manner.
They highlight the fact that cooperation is a possible alternative to our system based on exchanges (can you imagine a world without money? Well, the people that created the open source apparently could!).
And with the rise of new technologies like the Internet, open alternative will be easier and easier to put in place.</p>

<p>For example, Open Government is a way of implying the people living in a society in their governance.
The idea is to facilitate the communication between the government and the people: more transparency from the government to the society, more inputs from the people to the government, etc.
This could simplify the democratic process and even increase it.</p>

<p>All in all I strongly hope that open source will impose itself and maybe even change our society!</p>

	     <p>Binary operators are simple.
Nevertheless some non-trivial rules can be applied to them to make appear some other forms of an identical expression which allows us, for example, to make simplifications.</p>

</ol>

<h1 id="negation-of-a-negation">Negation of a Negation</h1>

<p>This rule is trivially proven by computing the truthtable of each expression.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\neg (\neg P) \leftrightarrow P</script>

<h1 id="de-morgan-laws">De Morgan Laws</h1>

<p>The De Morgan Laws state the following:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\neg(A \vee B) \leftrightarrow \bar A \wedge  \bar B</script>
and
<script type="math/tex">\neg (A \wedge B) \leftrightarrow \bar A \vee  \bar B</script></p>

<p>One can see this is true by putting side-to-side the thruthtables of the expressions on each side of the equivalence.</p>

<h1 id="if-then-equivalence">If Then Equivalence</h1>

<p>We also pretend \( A \rightarrow B \leftrightarrow \neg A \vee B \).

<h1 id="equivalence-equivalent-expression">Equivalence Equivalent Expression</h1>

<p>We give this last equivalence without proof, but it can easily be proved by a truthtable or by looking at the definition of the <em>equivalence</em> operator:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \wedge B) \vee (\bar A \wedge \bar B)</script>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Simple binary operators aren’t a structure powerful enough to define rules of reasoning.
This is where rules of inference come into play.
They are forms of reasoning that we can prove to be correct.
Let’s discover a few of them.</p>

<p>This article is the fourth in a series of four:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//intro-to-boolean-logic">Boolean Logic</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//complex-boolean-operators">“Complex” Boolean Operators</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//boolean-algebra">Boolean Algebra</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//rules-of-inference">Rules of Inference</a></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="rules-of-inference">Rules of Inference</h1>

<p>The general idea is the following: some propositions \( P_1 \), …, \( P_n \) are assumed to be true and one shows that accepting those propositions logically (in the sense of boolean logic) leads to saying that a conclusion proposition \( P_c \) must also be true.</p>

<p>\( P_1 \) to \( P_n \) are called the premises.
 \( P_c \) is called the conclusion.</p>

<p>There are quite many rules of inferences, here I will only cite the most useful ones.
Note that the rules of inferences do <em>not</em> concern themselves with the truth of the premises.
They are only used to deduce conclusions <em>when we assume the premises to be true</em>.</p>

<h2 id="modus-ponens">Modus Ponens</h2>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(P \wedge (P\rightarrow Q)) \rightarrow Q \leftrightarrow \text{true}</script>

<p>This form of argumentation is based on two premises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( P\rightarrow Q \) (The proposition “if \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) is true” is true)</li>
  <li>\( P \) ( \( P \) is true)</li>
</ul>

<p>From this, we can conclude that \( Q \) is true.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are rich, then you are beautiful</li>
  <li>You are rich</li>
</ul>

<p>It follows logically that you are beautiful!</p>

<p>It is possible to prove these rules using the boolean algebra defined in a <a href="/ASARPhiB//intro-to-boolean-logic">previous article</a>.
The proof for this rule of inference is given thereafter.
The proofs for the others rules of inference will not be given.
One can find them online or derive them using boolean algebra.</p>

<p>This is proof is given for the sake of example but is not explained in detailed:
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
(P \wedge (P \rightarrow Q)) \rightarrow Q &\leftrightarrow \neg (P \wedge (P \rightarrow Q)) \vee Q\\
  & \leftrightarrow (\bar P \vee \neg (P \rightarrow Q)) \vee Q\\
  & \leftrightarrow (\bar P \vee (P \wedge \bar Q)) \vee Q\\
  & \leftrightarrow (\bar P \wedge (Q \vee \bar Q)) \vee (P \wedge \bar Q) \vee (Q \wedge (P \vee \bar P))\\
  & \leftrightarrow (\bar P \wedge Q) \vee (\bar P \wedge \bar Q) \vee (P\wedge Q) \vee (\bar P \wedge Q)\\
  & \leftrightarrow \text{True}
\end{aligned} %]]></script></p>

<h2 id="modus-tolens">Modus Tolens</h2>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\neg Q \wedge (P\rightarrow Q)) \rightarrow \neg P \leftrightarrow \text{true}</script>

<p>This form of argumentation is based on two premises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( P\rightarrow Q \) (The proposition “if \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) is true” is true)</li>
  <li>\( \neg Q \) ( \( Q \) is false)</li>
</ul>

<p>From this, we can conclude that \( P \) is false.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are rich, then you are beautiful</li>
  <li>You are not beautiful</li>
</ul>

<p>It follows logically that you are not rich!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<h2 id="on-rules-of-inference">On Rules of Inference</h2>

<p>There exist a few more rules of inference.
They can also be extended to use the mathematical symbols <script type="math/tex">\forall</script> (for all) and <script type="math/tex">\exists</script> (it exists).
More informations about them can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I will try, in this blog, to be almost rigorous in the philosophical points I want to make; i.e. formulate them with rules of inference.</p>

<h2 id="on-philosophy">On Philosophy</h2>

<p>We saw that rules of inference only concern themselves with the articulation one can formulate between premises to deduce a conclusion.
So the whole debate is now shifted toward finding the correct premises or toward finding premises that can be accepted by everyone.</p>

<p>The conclusions will logically follow.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>The boolean operators <em>negation</em>, <em>AND</em> and <em>OR</em> suffice to represent all expressions.
However, it might some time be easier to define a few more operators for the sake of simplicity.
In this article, I will cover the <em>if then</em> and <em>equivalence</em> operators.</p>

<p>This article is the second article in a series of four:</p>

</ol>

<h1 id="two-more-binary-operators">Two More Binary Operators</h1>

<h2 id="implies-if--then-">Implies (if … then …)</h2>

<p>Let’s define the implication operator \( \rightarrow \).
It is a binary operator with the following truthtable:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\( A \)</th>
      <th>\( B \)</th>
      <th>\( C = A \rightarrow B \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We remark that \( C \) is false only when \( A \) is true and \( B \) is false.</p>

<p>I pretend that this operator is equivalent to saying “if A, then B”.</p>

<p>Let us define three propositions:</p>

<p>\( A \) = “I am elected maire”</p>

<p>\( B \) = “I increase taxes”</p>

<p>\( C \) = \( A \rightarrow B \)</p>

<p>I will now try to prove that this is the same as the sentence “If I am elected maire, then I will increase the taxes”.</p>

<p>Imagine a politician P, saying “If I am elected maire, then I will increase the taxes”.
If P is elected and he/she raises the taxes then he did not lie and C is true.
If P is elected but he/she does not increase the taxes, then he/she lied and the proposition was in fact false.
If P is not elected, then he/she said the truth when saying that if he/she got elected, he/she would raise the taxes in the sense that the person did not lie.
We see the exact same values in the truthtable of the implication operator.</p>

<h2 id="equivalence">Equivalence</h2>

<p>Let us finally define the binary operator equivalence represented with the symbol \( \leftrightarrow \) with the following truthtable:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\( A \)</th>
      <th>\( B \)</th>
      <th>\( A \leftrightarrow B \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I pretend that the equivalence operator applied to two propositions is equivalent to saying that two propositions are equivalent.
This comes from the fact that for two propositions to be equivalent, they need, for any given input, to be either both true or both false, but they cannot have different values.
One can remark that this is exactly what the truthtable says.</p>

<h2 id="extended-precedence-rules">Extended Precedence Rules</h2>

<p>We already saw the rules of precedence for the <em>negation</em>, <em>AND</em> and <em>OR</em> operators.
We now complete those rules with the two newly defined operators.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Negation</li>
  <li>AND</li>
  <li>OR</li>
  <li>Implication</li>
  <li>Equivalence</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="more-binary-operators">More binary operators</h2>

<p>There exists many more binary operators (XOR, XAND, etc) but the ones above are generally enough.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>With those tools in hand, we are ready to discover some simple rules of algebra that govern the world of logic and that we will later use to prove what a correct reasoning is.
Simple rules of algebra will be the topic of the next article: <a href="/ASARPhiB//boolean-algebra">Boolean Algebra</a>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>A strong and correct reasoning must, at the very least, be rooted in a rock solid logic.
This article tries to explain the basics of the boolean logic, one of the most commonly used logic in mathematics.</p>

<p>It is the first article in a series of four:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//intro-to-boolean-logic">Boolean Logic</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//complex-boolean-operators">“Complex” Boolean Operators</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//boolean-algebra">Boolean Algebra</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ASARPhiB//rules-of-inference">Rules of Inference</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The final goal of this series is to derive the so-called rules of inference that are rules to apply for correct reasoning.</p>

<h1 id="some-definitions">Some Definitions</h1>

<h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Proposition</dt>
  <dd>Let’s define a <em>proposition</em> \( P \) as a sentence that can either be <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, and nothing else (law of excluded middle).</dd>
</dl>

<p><em>Example: \( P \) = “It is snowing”</em></p>

<p><em>Remark: Some might argue that, in real life, a perfect binarity most often doesn’t exist.
It is more likely that a property can take a value in a gradient of possible values.
I totally agree with this point of view.
But I think it is still possible to define propositions that are either true or false but nothing else, by considering ranges of values.</em></p>

<p><em>For example, assume I define \( P \) as “X has brown hair”.
X might have dark brow hair, or aubrun hair…
Is \( P \) true or false then?
One possible solution is to better define the proposition \( P \) as “X has hair that are brown or darker”.</em></p>

<h2 id="compound-proposition">Compound Proposition</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Compound Proposition</dt>
  <dd>I now define a <em>compound proposition</em> as a proposition that is defined by relationships between other propositions.
I will call the other propositions <em>input propositions</em>.
The relationships are defined using <em>operators</em>.
We will see a few of them below.</dd>
  <dt>Truthtable</dt>
  <dd>Let’s also define the <em>truthtable</em> of a compound proposition as a table showing all the possible values that the input propositions can take and the value that the compound proposition take given the values of the input propositions.
For conciseness, <em>true</em> will be written <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> and <em>false</em> will be written <code class="highlighter-rouge">F</code> inside truthtables.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To create a compound proposition, one must link or combine one or more propositions together.
To combine propositions one uses so-called operators, they simply represent the kind of relationship there is between two propositions.</p>

<p>I will now define a few ways to combine propositions using unary and binary operators (operators that are applied on a single proposition or two propositions respectively).</p>

<h2 id="negation">Negation</h2>

<p>Let’s define a unary operation on a proposition called the negation of a proposition in the following way, the negation of a proposition that is <em>true</em> will yield <em>false</em>, the negation of a proposition that is <em>false</em> will yield <em>true</em>.
The negation of a proposition \( P \) is represented in the following way: \( \neg P \).
A second way to represent the negation of \( P \) is \( \bar P \).
I will use one or the other depending on which is more comfortable to read in a given context.</p>

<p>Here is the truthtable of the negation operation:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\( P \)</th>
      <th>\( \bar{P} \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I will now try to show that the negation operation corresponds to the negation as we understand it in the english language.</p>

<p>Let me define \( P \) as “It is snowing”.
This can either be <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.
Let me also remark that \( P \) yields <em>true</em> when it is snowing and <em>false</em> otherwise.</p>

<p>I pretend that the negation of a proposition is equivalent to the negation of the sentence that the proposition represent.
I am not sure if it is even possible to make a rigorous proof of this.
I can only hope that the following example convinces you, that you find it obvious enough or that someone propose us a proper proof of it.
This remark is valid for all following operators where I try to show the correspondences to the human language.</p>

<p>We now consider \( \bar{P} \).
By the definition of the negation operator, \( \bar{P} \) will yield <em>false</em> when it snows and <em>true</em> when it is not snowing.
This is equivalent to the proposition “It is not snowing” because it yield <em>true</em> when it is not snowing and <em>false</em> when it is snowing.</p>

<p><strong>Axiom</strong>: For a proposition defined as a sentence, the negation operation on the proposition is the same as the negation as we understand it in the English language of the sentence.</p>

<h2 id="and">AND</h2>

<p>Let me represent the AND operator with the following symbol: \( \wedge \).
The AND-composition of two propositions \( A \) and \( B \) is then represented the following way: \( A \wedge B \)</p>

<p>Furthermore, I define the truthtable of the AND-operator as follow:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\( A \)</th>
      <th>\( B \)</th>
      <th>\( A\wedge B \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In other words, \( A \wedge B \) is true if and only if \( A \) is true and \( B \) is true simultaneously.</p>

<p>I pretend that the AND operator on two propositions \( A \) and \( B \) is equivalent to saying “A and B” as we understand it in the English language.</p>

<p>Let’s consider the following propositions:</p>

<p>\( A \) = “I have brown eyes”</p>

<p>\( B \) = “I possess a car”</p>

<p>\( C \) = \( A \wedge B \)</p>

<p>We see that C, by the definition of the AND operator is only true if both \( A \) and \( B \) are true simultaneously.
We can also remark that the same reasoning applies in English: For us not to be liars when we say “I have brown eyes and I possess a car”, then we must both have brown eyes and possess a car.</p>

<p><strong>Axiom</strong>: The AND operator applied on two propositions \( A \), \( B \) is equivalent to saying “\( A \) and \( B \)” as we understand it in English.</p>

<h2 id="or">OR</h2>

<p>Let me define the OR operator as being false only if both \( A \) and \( B \) are false simultaneously.
I also define the following notation to represent it: \( A \vee B \).</p>

<p>Here is the truthtable of the OR operator:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\( A \)</th>
      <th>\( B \)</th>
      <th>\( A \vee B \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Remark: the OR operator does not correspond to the English “or”.
Let’s remark that when someone says “I can have an apple or a banana”, what is meant is that the person can have <em>either</em> an apple or a banana, but not both.
The OR operator would mean that you can have one or both.</p>

<p>We pretend that the OR operator is equivalent to saying “A or B or both”.</p>

<h2 id="precedence-rules">Precedence Rules</h2>

<p>For complex expressions involving many operators, we need to know in which order the operators are to be applied.</p>

<p>We arbitrarily define the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Negation</li>
  <li>AND</li>
  <li>OR</li>
</ol>

<p>We will use parenthesis to modify the order in which to apply the operators, in the following way: the operators inside a parenthesis should be applied before the operators outside of the parenthesis.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>These only three operators are enough for all the boolean logic.
They allow us to represent every possible operation on any number of input variables.
However, for the sake of brevity and simplicity, it is often preferable to define some more operators; two, in fact, that also have meaning in the spoken language.
This will be the topic of the next article: <a href="/ASARPhiB//complex-boolean-operators">Complex Boolean Operators</a></p>
