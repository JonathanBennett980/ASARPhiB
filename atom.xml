        <title>Pollution and Over-Population, the Modern Evils</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over-population, pollution, global warming, ecology.
We hear those often but was is really going on?
What is actually over-population or pollution?
Should we be concerned?
My answer: definitely Yes!
And here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Government</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;“Democracy” initially stands for: the power to the people.
Do you feel like you are in control?
If you answered no, learn what Open Government is and why we should adopt it !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Changing Matters?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a very peculiar time, one of technologies, of increasing speed, of ever evolving theories and concepts.
&lt;em&gt;To survive in such hostile environment, one has to adapt… fast!&lt;/em&gt;
This often imply learning new things to stay up to date, forging new habits, changing one’s way of thinking, embracing new cultures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Open (Source), a Revolution</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The open source movement is an alternative way of working and cooperating that could very well change our society.
It is based on cooperation instead of exchanges and is already a standard in the digital world.
But many applications of it are possible especially in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Rules of Inference</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Simple binary operators aren’t a structure powerful enough to define rules of reasoning.
This is where rules of inference come into play.
They are forms of reasoning that we can prove to be correct.
Let’s discover a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Boolean Algebra</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Binary operators are simple.
Nevertheless some non-trivial rules can be applied to them to make appear some other forms of an identical expression which allows us, for example, to make simplifications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>&quot;Complex&quot; Boolean Operators</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The boolean operators &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt; suffice to represent all expressions.
However, it might some time be easier to define a few more operators for the sake of simplicity.
In this article, I will cover the &lt;em&gt;if then&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;equivalence&lt;/em&gt; operators.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Introduction to Boolean Logic</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A strong and correct reasoning must, at the very least, be rooted in a rock solid logic.
This article tries to explain the basics of the boolean logic, one of the most commonly used logic in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
